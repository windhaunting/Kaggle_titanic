# Kaggle: Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

I tried to use simple neural network to predict the survival on the Titanic based on Pytorch implementation



## Algorithm Overview

- preprocess data, delete null data; encode categorized data, etc.

- Build a model with a simple neural network

- Predict on the test data

## Results:

Working well with the random forest method.
